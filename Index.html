        <p class="p2">Academic programs make teaching resources easier to afford and provides faculty with the tools 
         they need to provide students with the best learning experience possible. Ready-made resources and 
         content that can easily be added to curriculum helps faculty ensure student success.

          pocket, it can feel like technology is advancing at a breakneck pace. With this advancement 
          comes the creation of new job types. Jobs like data scientist, social media manager, 
          and app developer barely existed 10 years go and are now in high demand.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">Colleges and universities face the challenge of keeping up and providing students with 
         the skills and practical experience needed to be successful in these roles. Higher education 
         can use collaboration with industry to face this challenge. Not only does this close the skill gap, 
         but it also accelerates innovation and technological progress.A common form of collaboration between 
         higher education institutions and industry are academic programs.</p>
